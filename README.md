# Abstract
LiDAR sensors play a pivotal role in acquiring essential data in the form of 3D point clouds. The majority of prior studies have experimented with synthetic datasets containing precisely aligned data, while real world point clouds are often not aligned and iregular. The iregularity of LiDAR-generated point clouds poses challenges, particularly in transformation invariance and points iregularity. To address this, geometric transformation-based data augmentation is employed to enhance the PointNet model's ability to recognize objects with varying iregular points and transformation. The proposed methodology aims to improve the classification of 3D objects in LiDAR-scanned objects, enhancing the adaptability and robustness of models in real-world scenarios by combining a local and global jitter, rotation, and scale data augmentation to ModelNet40. In results, the augmented model exhibits a notable performance enhancement and resilience against rotational disturbances in the upper coordinates. The augmented model demonstrates a validation accuracy of 80.1% with randomly applied transformations while the highest transformation variation is rotation on the up axis, whereas the non-augmented model achieves an accuracy of 45.5%.
